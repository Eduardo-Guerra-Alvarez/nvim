# Configuration NVIM

First you need to install nvim in your MacOs
- I install with the command:
```
brew install nvim
```
- I have zsh and I installed [Oh my zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
you can write down the command in `./zshrc`
```
alias vim='nvim'
export EDITOR='nvim'
```
Now you can use vim as nvim

After that you need to create a file in `~./.config/nvim/init.vim`
and in this file you can configure your editor nvim

- If you can install plugins you need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
